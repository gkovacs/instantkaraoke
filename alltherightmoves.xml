    <lyrics>(All the right friends in all the right places)&#xD;
So yeah we're going down&#xD;
(All the right moves in all the right places)&#xD;
So yeah we're going down&#xD;
&#xD;
Paint a picture of the perfect place&#xD;
They've got it better than when anyone's told ya, &#xD;
I'll be the King of Hearts, you're the Queen of Spades&#xD;
And we'll fight for you like we were soldiers&#xD;
&#xD;
I know we've got it good&#xD;
But they've got it made&#xD;
And the grass is getting greener each day&#xD;
I know things are looking up&#xD;
But soon they'll take us down&#xD;
Before anybody's knowing our name&#xD;
&#xD;
They've got all the right friends in all the right places&#xD;
So yeah, we're going down&#xD;
They've got all the right moves in all the right faces&#xD;
So yeah, we're going down&#xD;
&#xD;
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going&#xD;
Yeah, we're going down&#xD;
I said, everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going&#xD;
Yeah, we're going down&#xD;
&#xD;
Do you think I'm special, do you think I'm nice&#xD;
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces&#xD;
Between the noise you hear and the sound you like&#xD;
Are we just sinking in the ocean of faces&#xD;
&#xD;
It can't be possible that rain can fall,&#xD;
Only when it's over our heads&#xD;
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away&#xD;
Over the world it's said, they've got, they've got&#xD;
&#xD;
All the right friends, in all the right places&#xD;
So yeah we're going down&#xD;
We got all the right moves in all the right places&#xD;
So yeah we're going down&#xD;
&#xD;
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going&#xD;
Yeah, we're going down&#xD;
Everybody knows, everybody knows where we're going&#xD;
Yeah, we're going down (going down, going down, going down, going down)&#xD;
&#xD;
It don't matter what you see&#xD;
I know I could never be&#xD;
Someone that'll look like you&#xD;
It don't matter what you say&#xD;
I know I could never face&#xD;
Someone that could sound like you&#xD;
&#xD;
(All the right friends, in all the right places&#xD;
So yeah we're going down&#xD;
They got all the right moves in all the right places&#xD;
So yeah we're going down)&#xD;
&#xD;
(All the right friends, in all the right places&#xD;
So yeah we're going down&#xD;
They got all the right moves in all the right places&#xD;
So yeah we're going down)&#xD;
&#xD;
Said, everybody knows everybody knows where we're going&#xD;
Yeah we're going down&#xD;
I said, everybody knows everybody knows where we're going&#xD;
Yeah we're going down (going down, going down, going down)&#xD;
&#xD;
Yeah we're going down&#xD;
Yeah we're going down&#xD;
(All the right moves, hey)&#xD;
Yeah we're going down&#xD;
(All the right moves, hey)&#xD;
Yeah we're going down</lyrics>
